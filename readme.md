Torch Integrated Cell
===============================
Image-driven generative cell modelling with adversarial autoencoders

## Installation
Installing on linux is recommended.

### prerequisites

- install torch on docker / nvidia-docker as in e.g. this guide: https://github.com/gregjohnso/dl-docker

### Steps:
After you clone this repository, you should be able to train the model using 

`bash train_model_2D.sh`

you will need to make the data available to the model by putting it in the XXX directory.

## Project website
Example outputs of this model can be viewed at http://www.allencell.org
